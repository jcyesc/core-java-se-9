# Processing Input and Output

The key points of this chapter are:

1. An `InputStream` is a source of bytes, and an `OutputStream` is a
destination for bytes.
2. A `Reader` reads characters, and a `Writer` writes them. Be sure to
specify a character encoding.
3. This `Files` class has convenience methods for reading all bytes
or lines of a file.
4. The `DataInput` and `DataOutput` interfaces have methods for writing numbers
in binary format.
5. Use a `RandomAccessFile` or a memory-mapped file for random access.
6. A Path is an absolute or relative sequence of path components in a file system.
Paths can be combine (or "resolved").
7. Use the methods of the Files class to copy, move, or delete files and to
recursively walk through a directory tree.
8. To read or update a ZIP file, use a ZIP file system.
9. You can read the contents of a web page with the URL class. To read metadata or
write data, use the `URLConnection` class.
10. With the `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes, you can find all matches of a regular
expression in a string, as well as the captured groups for each match.
11. The serialization mechanism can save and restore any object implementing
the `Serializable` interface, provided its instance variables are also serializable.
