# Internationalization

1. Translating an application for international users requires more than translating messages. In
particular, formatting for numbers and dates varies widely across the world.
2. A locale describes language and formatting preferences for a population of users.
3. The NumberFormat and DateTimeFormat classes handle locale-aware formatting of numbers,
currencies, dates, and times.
4. The `MessageFormat` class can format message strings with placeholders, each of which can
have its own format.
5. Use the Collator class for locale-dependent sorting of strings.
6. The `ResourceBundle` class manages localized strings and objects for multiple locales.
7. The `Preferences` class can be used for storing user preferences in a platform-independent way.
