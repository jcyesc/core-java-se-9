# Concurrent Programming

## Overview

1. A `Runnable` describes a task that can be executed asynchronously but does not
return a result.
2. An `ExecutorService` schedules tasks instances for execution.
3. A `Callable` describes a task that can be executed asynchronously and yields a result.
4. You can submit one or more `Callable` instances to an `ExecutorService` and combine
the results when they are available.
5. When multiple threads operate on shared data without synchronization the result
is unpredictable.
6. Prefer using parallel algorithms and threadsafe data structures over programming
with locks.
7. Parallel streams and array operations automatically and safely parallelize computations.
8. A `ConcurrentHashMap` is a threadsafe hash table that allows atomic update or entries.
9. You can use `AtomicLong` for a lock-free shared counter, or use `LongAdder` if contention
is high.
10. A lock ensures that only one thread at a time executes a critical section.
11. An interruptible task should terminate when the interrupted flag is set or an
`InterruptedException` occurs.
12. A long-running task should not block the user-interface thread of a program, but progress
and final updates need to occur in the user-interface thread.
13. The `Process` class lets you execute a command in a separate process and interact with the
input, output, and error streams.
