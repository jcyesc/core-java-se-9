Generics
 

1. A generic class is a class with one or more type parameters.
2. A generic method is a method with type parameters.
3. You can require a type parameter to be a subtype of one or more types.
4. Generic types are invariant: When S is a subtype of T, there is no
   relationship between `G<S>` and `G<T>`.
5. By using wildcards `G<? extends T>` or `G<? super T>`, you can specify that
  a method can accept an instantiation of a generic type with a subclass or
  superclass argument.
6. Type parameters are erased when generic classes and methods are compiled.
7. Erasure puts many restrictions on generic types. In particular, you can't
  instantiate generic classes or arrays, cast to a generic type, or throw an
  object of a generic type.
8. The `Class<T>` class is generic, which is useful because methods such as cast
  are declared to produce a value of type T.
9. Even though generic classes and methods are erased in the virtual machine,
  you can find out at runtime how they were declared.
