# The Java Platform Module System

1. The Java Platform Module System was designed to modularize the Java platform.
2. You can use the Java Platform Module System to modularize applications and libraries.
3. A module is a collection of packages.
4. The properties of a module are defined in `module-info.java`.
5. A module declares on which other modules it depends.
6. A module provides encapsulation. Accessible packages must be explicitly exported.
7. A module may allow reflective access to private features by opening a package
or the entire module.
8. The module system provides support for the `ServiceLoader` facility.
9. A modular JAR is a JAR with a `module-info.class` file that is placed on the module path.
10. By placing a regular JAR on the module path, it becomes an automatic module
that exports and opens all of its packages.
11. All packages on the class path form the unnamed module.
12. To migrate existing applications, you may need to override access restrictions with command-line
options.
13. The `jdeps` tool analyzes the dependencies of a given set of JAR files. The `jlink` tool
produces an application with minimal dependencies.
